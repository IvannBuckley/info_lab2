                <p> Lana Del Rey, on the other hand, has always been a master of storytelling. Her melancholic sound, combined with cinematic production, explores the darker sides of love, fame, and the passage of time. Del Rey's ability to weave together tales of heartbreak and longing with nostalgic and often dreamy instrumentals sets her apart as a visionary in alternative pop. Whether reflecting on the pain of lost love or the complexities of life in the public eye, she brings a unique voice to modern music .Lastly, Mitski’s music carries a raw emotional weight, touching on themes of identity, loneliness, and desire. Her distinct sound and introspective lyrics continue to resonate with fans across genres, solidifying her place as one of the most influential voices in modern music.</p>
